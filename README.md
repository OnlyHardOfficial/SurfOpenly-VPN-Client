# SurfOpenly VPN Client

A free and open source VPN client written in VB.NET to overcome the unavailability of such softwares. SurfOpenly was a commercial product but with the release of v5, we decided to make it open source. Thus, everyone will be able to modify it and enhance its capabilities.

The core features of this software is to make connections to PPTP, L2TP and SSTP protocols. It's very nice and clean GUI written with WPF.

The software project files are compatible with VS 2015 and above.
